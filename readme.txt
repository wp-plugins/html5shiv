== Description ==
This plugin adds the HTML5shiv Javascript library with IE Print Protector to your WordPress installation.

Internet Explorer will not recognize all HTML5 elements. Unlike Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and the rest of the browser world who will gladly assume the element is acceptable, and render / CSS just like any other element — Internet Explorer ignores them. If you used tags on your site, Internet Explorer (yes, even 8 ) will just ignore the existence of the code.
 
HTML5 Shiv (by remysharp) takes advantage of the Internet Explorer rendering engine's ability to handle these elements only after they have been inserted into the DOM via document.createElement — and works well.
 
== Installation ==
1. Upload `html5shiv.php` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
